    <title>Inter Font Example</title>

    <!-- 
    🕰️ Historical Context:
    Google Fonts launched in 2010 as a free and simple CDN-based way to load fonts across the web.
    The Inter font was designed by Rasmus Andersson and released in 2016. It became widely adopted due to its screen-optimized readability
    and support for variable font axes such as weight, italic, and optical sizing (opsz).

    ✅ Preconnect:
    These lines establish early connections to Google's font servers (fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com),
    reducing DNS resolution and TCP handshake latency for faster font loading.
  -->
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />

    <!-- 
    ✅ Google Fonts CSS:
    This loads the Inter font with support for italic, optical size, and all weight ranges (100–900).
    The 'display=swap' strategy avoids render-blocking by immediately showing fallback fonts while Inter is loading.
    
    📦 Caching Behavior:
    - The browser will download only the required font faces and Unicode ranges (thanks to unicode-range filtering).
    - The actual WOFF2 files served from fonts.gstatic.com are cached for up to 1 year (via Cache-Control headers).
    - These font files are reused across websites that use the same font URLs, improving performance for repeat visits.

    <h1>Using Inter from Google Fonts</h1>
    <p>
      Inter is a modern variable font designed for screen readability. With multiple axes like <code>weight</code> and <code>opsz</code>, it adapts
      well to various UI and content scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the necessary font faces (based on weight/style/text content) are downloaded. Cached font files are reused across sites using the same
      Google Fonts URLs, making the experience faster for users who’ve visited other sites with Inter.
